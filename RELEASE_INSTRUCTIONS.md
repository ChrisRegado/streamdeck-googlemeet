# Release Guide

This document explains how to publish a new release of the Stream Deck plugin and browser extensions.

## First Time Firefox Add-on Setup

If you're setting up the project in a new GitHub repo (or you're creating a fork), there's some initial work you'll need to do to get Firefox extension signing configured.

First, prepare an (unsigned) build of the extension to submit to Mozilla for initial approval:

1. Create your own UUID to use as your Firefox extension ID. (On macOS or Linux, try running `uuidgen`.)
2. Update `browser-extension/manifest_firefox_stub.json` and change the `browser_specific_settings.gecko.id` field to be your new UUID wrapped in curly braces.
3. From within the `browser-extension` directory, run `npm install && npm run build && npm run package-firefox`. This should create a zip file named `browser-extension/build/stream_deck_google_meet_actions-0.0.1.zip`. We'll use that file soon.

Now we'll go to the Firefox Add-on website and create the add-on:

1. Go to the [Firefox Add-on Developer Hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/) and create an account, or sign in with your Firefox account if you already have one.
2. Click [My Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/addons).
3. Click "Submit a New Add-on", and when asked "how you would like to distribute this version", select `On your own`. (Don't list the add-on on the public store.)
4. Upload the extension build artifact from earlier (`browser-extension/build/stream_deck_google_meet_actions-0.0.1.zip`).
5. Wait for approval from Mozilla. The plugin will likely get auto-approved within a few minutes.

Finally, we'll add auth tokens from the Firefox Add-on portal as GitHub Action secrets so you can have automated release builds in CI:

1. Go back to the Firefox Add-on Developer Hub and go to "Tools" --> "[Manage API Keys](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/)".
2. If you don't see any existing credentials on that page, create a new API key.
3. Save the `JWT issuer` and `JWT secret`.
4. In your GitHub repo (or fork), click on the Settings tab (e.g. https://github.com/ChrisRegado/streamdeck-googlemeet/settings), and click on "Secrets and variables" --> "Actions" in the sidebar.
5. Using the "New repository secret" button, create two new repository secrets:
    * A secret named `FIREFOX_JWT_ISSUER`, whose value must be set to the `JWT issuer` from the Firefox Add-on site.
    * A secret named `FIREFOX_JWT_SECRET`, whose value must be set to the `JWT secret` from the Firefox Add-on site.

## Releasing a New Version

Follow these steps each time you want to release a new version of the plugin and/or browser extension:

1. Tag the commit you wish to release and push it to GitHub. We use semantic versioning with a "v" prefix for our releases. For example: `git checkout master && git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin tag v1.2.3`
    * Our CI jobs will update version numbers automatically to match that tag for both the plugin and browser extensions. You don't need to manually change any version numbers in code/config.
2. CI jobs should automatically launch against that tag to build the [Stream Deck plugin](https://github.com/ChrisRegado/streamdeck-googlemeet/actions/workflows/streamdeck-plugin-build.yml) and [browser extensions](https://github.com/ChrisRegado/streamdeck-googlemeet/actions/workflows/browser-extension-build.yml). (The list of workflow runs should show one copy of each of those two jobs with your `v1.2.3` tag.) Wait for them to complete successfully.
3. Click into those two build jobs, and on each job's "Summary" tab, download our build artifacts. The browser extension build job should have `chrome-extension` and `firefox-extension-signed` artifacts, and the plugin build job should have `com.chrisregado.googlemeet.streamDeckPlugin`.
4. Do a final manual validation of those release artifacts. Install the plugin, Firefox extension, and Chrome extension, and verify basic functionality.
5. On the Github page for your repo, click "Releases". (https://github.com/ChrisRegado/streamdeck-googlemeet/releases)
6. Click "Draft a new release".
7. Click the "Tag" button and select the tag you made in the previous step.
8. Use the your tag name as the "Release title", and enter a description summarizing notable changes in this release.
9. Select the "Set as a pre-release" checkbox near the bottom of the page.
10. Click "Publish release".
11. Our [release CI job](https://github.com/ChrisRegado/streamdeck-googlemeet/actions/workflows/release.yaml) should automatically start and attach our tag's artifacts to the GitHub Release. Wait for it to complete. If all goes well, in a minute or two you should see 3 attachments appear on the release: the `com.chrisregado.googlemeet.streamDeckPlugin` plugin, a zip of the Chrome extension, and an `.xpi` file for the Firefox extension.
12. Edit the release, uncheck the "Set as a pre-release" checkbox at the bottom of the page, select the "Set as the latest release" checkbox, and click "Update release".
